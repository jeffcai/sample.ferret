Ferret [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.ferret.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.ferret)
======

This sample project contains a simple Servlet application called Ferret. Ferret listens for HTTP requests sent to `<host>:<port>/ferret[/*]`, and responds with information about the request and the server.

## To deploy on Kubernetes

```
git clone https://github.com/jeffcai/sample.ferret
cd sample.ferret
// package the war 打包
mvn war:war
// build and push the image, and modify the tag first 准备和推送镜像，注意修改 tag
docker build -t us.icr.io/wasliberty-test/sample-ferret:1.0 .
docker push us.icr.io/wasliberty-test/sample-ferret:1.0
// deploy, at first the mofidy the deployment yaml to use your tagged image 部署，注意修改文件 kubernetes /sample-deploy-svc.yaml 里面的 image
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes
// access the application withe url below, at fist you need get the service nodeport. 访问应用，注意先运行 kubectl get svc 找到相应 service 的 nodeport，用下面的 URL 访问
http://<node-ip>:<node-port>/ferret/
```

## Running in Eclipse

### Maven
1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Create a new Liberty Profile Server. See [step 3](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/) for details.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
5. Deploy the sample into Liberty server. Right click on the *ferret* sample and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select the Liberty profile server and press *Finish*.
6. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/ferret][]

### Gradle
1. Go to *Help > Eclipse Marketplace > Install Buildship Gradle Integration 2.0*
2. Clone this project and import into Eclipse as an 'Existing Gradle Project'.
3. Go to *Window > Show View > Other > Gradle Executions & Gradle Tasks*
4. Go to Gradle Tasks view and run `clean` in build folder, then `build` in build folder, then `libertyStart` in liberty folder.
5. You should see the following in the console: `Application ferret started in XX.XX seconds.`

## Running in the Command Line

### Maven cmd-line
This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). 
The project uses the [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE Web Profile 7 runtime from [Maven Central][]. 
The Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute the full Maven build. The Liberty Maven Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server 
Ferret sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/ferret][].

Please refer to the [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] repository for documentation about using the Liberty Maven Plug-in.

### Gradle cmd-line

This project can also be built and run with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). 
The provided `build.gradle` file applies the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in][] and is configured to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE Web Profile 7 runtime from [Maven Central][]. 
The Liberty Gradle Plug-in has built-in tasks that can be used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server.
  
Use the following steps to run the application with the Gradle wrapper (Windows machines use `gradlew.bat`):

1. Execute the full Gradle build. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    ```
    
2. To start the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyStart
    ```
    
    Alternatively, execute the run command:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyRun --no-daemon
    ```
    
Once the server has started, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/ferret][].

3. To stop the server, execute:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyStop
    ```  

Note, if Gradle is properly installed, Gradle commands can be executed directly using `gradle` and wouldn't require `gradlew`.

Please refer to the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in][] repository for documentation about using the Liberty Gradle Plug-in.
